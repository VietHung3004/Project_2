# ðŸ©º Lung Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
This project applies **Machine Learning** techniques to predict the likelihood of **lung cancer** based on patients' medical data and lifestyle habits.  
The goal is to assist doctors and patients in **early detection** and **making timely treatment decisions**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Collect and process medical data related to lung cancer.
- Build predictive models using Random Forest, KNN, XGBoost, etc.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
- Create a simple interface for users to input data and receive prediction results.
